### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Alessandro, I work as a Staff Software Engineer at Google. This is where I keep the code for my experiments and side projects, as well as some OSS I occasionally contribute to.

I write about things I learn ([on my site](https://abahgat.com)).

You can [**follow me on Twitter**](https://twitter.com/abahgat) if you want to know what I am up to.
